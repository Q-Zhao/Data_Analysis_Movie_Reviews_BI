# Analysis of MovieLen Data
Label: Data Analysis, Movie Review

##Brief Description

This project is a team case study in class DS501 (Introduction to Data Science) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). It explored people's opinions on movies based the "Movie_Len" dataset downloaded from http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens, which containing about 1 million anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users since 2000. By using Python libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy and Scikit-learn, we interpreted and analyzed the data values and connections among users information, movies information and rating information. In addition, we are trying to answer the following two potential business intelligence question:
(1) If we have a new movie, what should we do for best advertising?
(2) If we have a new movie, and we purchased some information about how many males/females watched it (e.g. from YouTube), and what occupations and ages these people are (e.g. from Internet provider company), but we do not know if people like it or not. Besides box-office information in theatre, can we get a rough idea if people who watched this movie like it or not?
